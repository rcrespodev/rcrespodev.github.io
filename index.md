## About Me <a name="aboutMe"></a>
_"Don't be a developer. Be a problem resolver"_

The experience broke me that, in IT industry, isn't enough with just a set of technical skills to achieve a product
successful. These skills must be accompanied by the rights soft skills to deliver an optimal solution for the business.
It's the sum of both types of skills that allows the developer to understand and materialize the business
needs and requirements into authentic software applications.

So my goal is to continue nurturing myself with technical and non-technical skills, in order to continue building a
quality professional profile that provides the maximum value to each project in which im participates as **Individual
Contributor**.

I'm from **Buenos Aires, Argentina** and have 3 years of verifiable experience in backend development of business
applications based on the **SAP ERP S/HANA** systems, both **Cloud and On Premise solutions**, using ABAP language.

Actually, I'm looking for a job jump towards new languages and technologies related to _backend development_ and _devops
culture_, such as _golang_, _python_, _sql and non-sql databases_, _kubernetes_, _CI/CD_, etc.
